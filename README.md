# Dijkstra NY Road Network
An implementation of dijkstra in C using 3-ary heap over the New York city road network.

The goal is to have a better understanding on the heap behaviour related to the amount of nodes and the tree size per iteration as well as execution time of the whole algorithm using the 3-ary heap as the data structure for the priority queue.

The graph of the NY road network has 264,346 vertices and 733,846 arcs and can be downloaded at http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml
